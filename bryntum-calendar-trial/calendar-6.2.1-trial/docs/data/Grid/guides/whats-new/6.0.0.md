# What's new in Grid v6.0.0

## LockRows feature

This feature allows records which satisfy a certain condition to be locked at the top of the grid.

By default the condition is that a certain named field have a truthy value. The field which decides
this status defaults to `'fixed'`, but that is configurable using the `fieldName` property.

When used with `fieldName`, the `CellMenu` context menu appears with an extra option to toggle the value of
that field in the contextual record. For more granular control, use the `filterFn` to decide which records
should be locked.

This feature is **disabled** by default.

## Lazy data loading (infinite scroll)

[Stores](#Core/data/Store) now has support for lazy loading of data. In the Grid this means it is possible to
continuously load records when they scroll into view, instead of loading the complete dataset at once. 

Set the [lazyLoad](#Core/data/Store#config-lazyLoad) config on the Store to `true` to enable this
behaviour. For the initial load, either use [autoLoad](#Core/data/Store#config-autoLoad) or call the 
[load](#Core/data/Store#function-load) function.

If you are using an [AjaxStore](#Core/data/AjaxStore) to handle the API requests, it is just a matter of implementing
the backend to support lazy loading, and you are good to go.

```javascript
new Grid({
    store: {
        // This will create an AjaxStore
        readUrl  : 'backend/read',
        // This will activate the lazy load functionality
        lazyLoad : true,
        // This will load the Store initially upon creation
        autoLoad : true
    }
});
```

The backend will receive a request with `startIndex` and `count` params. Implement this params in your data query to
only return this range of records. 

For a detailed explanation of the lazy load functionality, please read our [guide](#Grid/guides/data/lazyloading.md).
There is also a new [demo](https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/infinite-scroll/) that uses an express.js backend 
to demonstrate the functionality.

## Column Header Widgets

This feature allows you to embed widgets directly in the [Column](#Grid/column/Column) headers. You can place buttons,
 combos, and other widgets in your column headers.

Here is a basic example of how [headerWidgets](#Grid/column/Column#config-headerWidgets) can be used:

```javascript
new Grid({
    columns : [
        {
            field         : 'status',
            text          : 'Status',
            headerWidgets : [
                {
                    type    : 'button',
                    text    : 'Completed Status Only',
                    icon    : 'b-fa b-fa-filter',
                    onClick : function() {
                        this.store.filter({
                            property : 'status',
                            value    : 'Completed',
                            operator : '='
                        });
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
});
```

You can also check our Javascript [demo](https://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/nested-grid-with-chart) or our 
React [demo](http://bryntum.com/products/grid/examples/frameworks/react-vite/nonworkingdays) which use `headerWidgets`.

## Date Range Field

A new field type for editing a range of dates, for example when booking flights or hotel reservations. The new widget
makes it easy to add an intuitive user interface for entering a start and end date, with support for customizable 
rendering of calendar dates.

```javascript
    items : [{
        type  : 'daterangefield',
        label : 'Date range'
    }]
```

<div class="external-example" data-file="Core/widget/DateRangeFieldCellRenderer.js"></div>
