# Customizing keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are easily customized. Provide a `keyMap` config object with the keyboard key or combination as the
property name, and the action (function name) as value. Key combinations are case-insensitive.

The invoking `KeyboardEvent` is passed as the first argument into all handlers.

The owning Widget of the KeyMap is injected into the passed `KeyboardEvent` in the `widget` property.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    keyMap: {
        // Changing keyboard navigation to respond to WASD keys.
        w : 'navigateUp',
        a : 'navigateLeft',
        s : 'navigateDown',
        d : 'navigateRight',
        
        // Removes mappings for arrow keys.
        ArrowUp    : null,
        ArrowLeft  : null,
        ArrowDown  : null,
        ArrowRight : null
    }
});
```
Modifier keys (`Ctrl`, `Alt`, `Shift`, and `Meta`) are also supported.

Note: For Mac users, the `Command (⌘)` key is equivalent to the `Ctrl` key on other platforms, however, this modifier
key is presented as `metaKey` by the browser. For this reason, `metaKey` and `ctrlKey` are swapped to `Ctrl` and
`Meta` modifier names (respectively) on the Mac platform.

Further, the `Alt` key is known as the `Option (⌥)` key on the Mac keyboard.

See [the docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/keydown_event) for details on keyboard events.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    keyMap: {
        'Ctrl+h'       : 'navigateFirstColumn',
        'Ctrl+e'       : 'navigateLastColumn',
        'Ctrl+Shift+h' : 'navigateFirstCell',
        'Ctrl+Shift+e' : 'navigateLastCell'
    }
});
```

## Features

Grid features provides their own keyboard shortcuts. These will be applied to the Grid's keyMap with the feature name
prefixed to the action. A feature keyboard shortcut can easily be customized by configuring the Grid's keyMap:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    // Customize feature's keyMap in Grid's keyMap
    keyMap: {
        'Ctrl+n' : 'search.gotoNextHit',
        'F3'     : null,
        'Ctrl+g' : null
    }
});
```

## Multi-action combinations

A keyboard combination can sometimes be used for multiple actions across different components and different features. 
For most of these cases only one of the action handlers will recognize the action as something it will apply its logic 
to. However, some actions do collide. And for that there is a prioritization configuration property named `weight` 
built-in to the keyMap functionality.

```javascript
// Default keyMap configuration for ContextMenuBase
keyMap : {
   'Space' : { handler : 'showContextMenuByKey', weight : 100 }
}
```

Please note that customizing these keyboard shortcuts can have side effects not intended and not always easily 
recognizable. A quick way to get the complete list of active keyboard shortcuts is when the Grid has finished its 
configuration process, log out the value of the property `keyMap` of the Grid instance object.

If you know what you are doing, the `weight` configuration can be a tool to configure more actions for the same keyboard 
combination. The colliding actions will be put in an array sorted by the largest `weight` last. The actions will then be
called from beginning to end, until one not returns `false`. Not providing a `weight` puts the action on the top of the
queue.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    feature: {
        tree: {
            keyMap : {
                // Instead of using a string action, use an object with a
                // handler and a weight property.
                ' ' : { handler: 'toggleCollapseByKey', weight: 1000}
                // This will affect the Tree feature's Space keyboard shortcut
                // to (probably) be called last of all actions on Space.
            }
        }
    }
});
```

Removing a weighted keyboard combination action is almost always safe to do:

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    keyMap: {
        // Changing keyboard navigation to respond to WASD keys.
        w : 'navigateUp',
        a : 'navigateLeft',
        s : 'navigateDown',
        d : 'navigateRight',
        
        // Removes mappings for arrow keys. These all have a weight, but
        // removal is safe to do
        ArrowUp    : null,
        ArrowLeft  : null,
        ArrowDown  : null,
        ArrowRight : null
    }
});
```

## Adding new keyboard combination actions

If you want to run a function by a keyboard combination it is very easy to set up using the keyMap configuration. Either
add a new function to your Grid class, use an existing function from the API or just provide a function or a function
handle in the configuration.

```javascript
const grid = new Grid({
    keyMap : {
        // This is a function from the existing Grid API
        'Ctrl+R'       : 'refreshRows',

        // This is a function provided directly in the configuration object
        'Ctrl+O'       : () => location.href = './logout'
    }
});

class MyGrid extends Grid{
    static configurable = {
        keyMap: {
            // This function must be available on the Grid subclass
            'Ctrl+Shift+M' : 'sendReminderEmail',
        }
    };
    
    sendReminderEmail(){
        myApi.post('./sendmail');
    }
}
```

If the current keyboard shortcut has multiple actions, and you want actions after your action to be called, the function
should return `false`. This will make the keyMap functionality continue calling the other actions until one not returns
`false`.


```javascript
class myGrid extends Grid {
    static configurable = {
        keyMap: {
            'Space': { action: 'openSomething', weight : 0 }
        }
    }
    
    openSomething(){
        new Something(this.selectedRecords).open();
        // Return false to continue calling other Space actions
        // (probably opens the context menu)
        return false;
    }
}
```
