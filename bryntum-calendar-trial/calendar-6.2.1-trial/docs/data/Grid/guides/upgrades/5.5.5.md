# Upgrade guide for Grid v5.5.5

## The `autoClose` config of `PickerField` was deprecated

The autoClose config of PickerField controls if the picker is hidden when the user clicks
outside of the picker. Setting it to false leads to a non-intuitive behavior, which we no
longer want to support. The config has been deprecated and will be removed in 6.0
