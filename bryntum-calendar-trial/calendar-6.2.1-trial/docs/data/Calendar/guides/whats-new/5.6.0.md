# What's new in Calendar v5.6.0

## New npm packages for combining products

This release introduces a new set of npm packages and framework components, that allows combining multiple Bryntum
products in the same application.

These packages contain the product specific code only, as opposed to the current packages that has all code for the
products each product builds upon (for example Scheduler contains all code from Grid & Core).

The new packages are called `thin` packages, and moving forward it will be the recommended way of using Bryntum
products in npm based applications (for all supported frameworks). The packages are initially available for licensed
users only, but will be made available for trial users in the near future.

The following packages are available:

| Package                    | Purpose                                     |
|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| @bryntum/core-thin         | Bryntum Core data and UI components package |
| @bryntum/grid-thin         | Bryntum Grid component package              |
| @bryntum/scheduler-thin    | Bryntum Scheduler component package         |
| @bryntum/schedulerpro-thin | Bryntum Scheduler Pro component package     |
| @bryntum/gantt-thin        | Bryntum Gantt component package             |
| @bryntum/calendar-thin     | Bryntum Calendar component package          |
| @bryntum/taskboard-thin    | Bryntum TaskBoard component package         |
| @bryntum/engine-thin       | Bryntum Scheduling engine component package |

Applications should install packages for the products they use, and the products those are built upon (see links to
guides below for more information). For example an application using Scheduler Pro should also install Scheduler, Grid &
Core:

```bash
npm install @bryntum/core-thin @bryntum/grid-thin @bryntum/scheduler-thin @bryntum/schedulerpro-thin
```

There are also new corresponding wrappers for the supported frameworks, which should be used instead of the current
wrappers. For example for React:

| Package                          | Purpose                                        |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| @bryntum/core-react-thin         | Bryntum Core UI widgets React wrappers package |
| @bryntum/grid-react-thin         | Bryntum Grid React wrapper package             |
| @bryntum/scheduler-react-thin    | Bryntum Scheduler React wrapper package        |
| @bryntum/schedulerpro-react-thin | Bryntum Scheduler Pro React wrapper package    |
| @bryntum/gantt-react-thin        | Bryntum Gantt React wrapper package            |
| @bryntum/calendar-react-thin     | Bryntum Calendar React wrapper package         |
| @bryntum/taskboard-react-thin    | Bryntum TaskBoard React wrapper package        |

Applications should install wrappers **only** for the products they use, there is **no** need to install them for the
products those are built upon. For example an application using Scheduler Pro:

```bash
npm install @bryntum/schedulerpro-react-thin
```

## Recurring TimeRanges

The definitions of TimeRanges as loaded by the `TimeRanges` Feature may now contain a `recurrenceRule`
field, and will now recur as specified in the UI.

## Functions and events declarations for TypeScript have been improved

Declarations of class config/property functions and events (which are represented as **onEventName** functions) were
improved to contain all available parameters and return type.

See examples below:

**Old declarations:**

```typescript
    /**
     * User typed into the field. Please note that the value attached to this event is the raw input field value and
     * not the combos value
     */
    onInput: Function|string

    /**
     * Template function that can be used to customize the displayed value
     */
    displayValueRenderer: Function
```

**New declarations:**

```typescript
    /**
     * User typed into the field. Please note that the value attached to this event is the raw input field value and
     * not the combos value
     */
    onInput: ((event : { source: Combo, value: string, event: Event }) => void)|string

    /**
     * Template function that can be used to customize the displayed value
     */
    displayValueRenderer: (record: Model, combo: Combo) => string|null
```
