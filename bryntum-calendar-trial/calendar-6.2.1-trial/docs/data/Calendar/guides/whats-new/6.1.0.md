# What's new in Calendar v6.1.0

## New `MonthAgenda` view type

A mobile-specific month view in which the top half of the Calendar is a `CalendarDatePicker` with event load
shown as `'dots'` or `'count'`. The bottom half is a captive `AgendaView` which shows the events for the
selected date.

<div class="external-example" data-file="Calendar/widget/CalendarMonthAgendaView.js"></div>

## New `DayAgenda` view type

This view shows a simple, serial view of events for a day, ordered by `startDate` ascending. The event block size
is determined purely by the content and the available width. No sizing is applied.

<div class="external-example" data-file="Calendar/widget/CalendarDayAgendaView.js"></div>

## New `ScheduleTooltip` feature

When enabled, the `scheduleTooltip` feature shows a tooltip containing the hovered time in `DayView`s (`WeekView` is
a `DayView` fixed to a range of one week))

<div class="external-example" data-file="Calendar/feature/ScheduleTooltip.js"></div>

## New `EventBuffer` feature

When enabled, the `eventBuffer` feature shows preamble and postamble times as a line with an optional label above and
below events in  `DayView`s (`WeekView` is a `DayView` fixed to a range of one week))

<div class="external-example" data-file="Calendar/feature/EventBuffer.js"></div>
