# What's new in Calendar v6.1.0

## New `eventDots` config in `CalendarDatePicker`, `MonthAgendaView` and `YearView`

The `eventDots` config may now be used to control exactly how the set of event dots
below a date cell is layed out. It is an object which may contain the following options:

 - `marginTop` (Number) - The margin above the dots. Default is 4.
 - `max` (Number) - The maximum number of dots to show. Default is 4.
 - `gap` (Number) - The gap between dots. Default is 3.
 - `size` (Number) - The size of the dots. Default is 5.
 - `stripe` (Boolean) - If `true`, the dots will be striped, meaning they will be
   joined together with _no gap_ between them and rounded at each end. Default is `false`.

If the `max` property is 1, the dots will be coloured using the default event colour,
*not* the colour of the event. This is to create a consistent appearance.

See the [Month Agenda example](https://bryntum.com/products/calendar/examples/month-agenda/) for usage.
