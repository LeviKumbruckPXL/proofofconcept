# What's new in Calendar v6.0.0

## New recurring event options

When creating a new recurring event, an augmented set of recurrence types are offered in the
dropdown, contextualized for the current date of the event. For example if the event was on a
Wednesday, the list will be augmented with options such as "Monthly on the first Wednesday".

The currently offered set of options is still available, the text for these now describes the
offered recurrence pattern more fully.

## `eventCount` property in all Calendar modes.

All Calendar modes now expose an `eventCount` property which yields the number of *visible* events
which intersect the view's date range. This is a convenience property for creating view description.
