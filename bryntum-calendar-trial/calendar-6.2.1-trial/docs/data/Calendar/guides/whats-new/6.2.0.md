# What's new in Calendar 6.2.0

## Accessibility

The Calendar is fully operable solely using the keyboard, and all focusable elements are labelled to tell assistive
technologies contextual details. See the [Calendar class's API docs](#Calendar/view/Calendar#accessibility) for details.

## `tickRenderer` property of `DayView`

The [tickRenderer](#Calendar/widget/DayView#config-tickRenderer) of `DayView` (`WeekView` and `DayResourceView` are 
`DayView`s) allows content to be placed in the hour/half hour etc. ticks of the `DayView`. Try it out in the new
`resource-time-capacity` demo.
