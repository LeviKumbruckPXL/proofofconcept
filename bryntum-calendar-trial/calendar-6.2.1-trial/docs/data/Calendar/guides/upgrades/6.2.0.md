# Upgrade guide for Calendar v6.2.0
## AjaxHelper.fetch credentials change

The `AjaxHelper.fetch()` utility function is used by `AjaxStore` and `CrudManager` to fetch data from the server.
Previously it by default used the `credentials: 'include'` option, which meant that cookies were always sent with the
request. To better match the default behavior of the native `fetch` API, our default value has been removed (thus it
instead uses `'same-origin'`, which is the native default). If you want to restore the old behavior, you can do so using
`AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS`:

**Old code**
```javascript
new CrudManager({
    loadUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```

**New code**
```javascript
AjaxHelper.DEFAULT_FETCH_OPTIONS = { credentials : 'include' };

new CrudManager({
    loadUrl  : 'load.php',
    autoLoad : true
})
```
