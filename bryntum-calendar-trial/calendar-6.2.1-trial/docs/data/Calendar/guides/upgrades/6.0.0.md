# Upgrade guide for Calendar v6.0.0

## `BryntumProjectModel` framework wrapper is no longer available
  
It was previously deprecated (in v5.6.0). Use `BryntumCalendarProjectModel` instead.

### Angular

**app.component.ts:**

```typescript
import { BryntumCalendarProjectModel } from '@bryntum/calendar-angular';
```

**app.component.html:**

```html
<bryntum-calendar-project-model
   #project
   // Project properties   
/>
```

### React

**App.tsx:**

```typescript
import { BryntumCalendarProjectModel } from '@bryntum/calendar-react';

...

function App() {
    return (
        <>
            <BryntumCalendarProjectModel
                ref={project}
                // Project properties
            />
        </>
    );
}
```

### Vue

**App.vue:**

```javascript
<template>
    <bryntum-calendar-project-model
        ref="project"
        // Project properties
    />
</template>

<script>
    import { BryntumCalendarProjectModel } from '@bryntum/calendar-vue-3';

    export default {
        components : {
            BryntumCalendarProjectModel
        }
    };
</script>
```

## New location for `Core.util.helper.Point` class

The `Core.util.helper.Point` class was moved in v5.6.0 to solve circular module dependencies. It is now a named 
(`Point`) export of the `Core.util.helper.Rectangle` module.

Changes are required if you are directly importing the class from sources:

**Old code:**

```javascript
import Point from 'path-to-lib/Core/helper/util/Point.js';
```

**New code:**

```javascript
import { Point } from 'path-to-lib/Core/helper/util/Rectangle.js';
```

Note: No changes required for importing from module or umd bundles.

## `ScrollOptions` renamed to `BryntumScrollOptions`

The name changed in v5.6.0 to avoid confusion with native `ScrollOption`. If you use TypeScript in your application 
rename imported type `ScrollOptions` to `BryntumScrollOptions`.

**Old code:**

```typescript
import { ScrollOptions } from '@bryntum/calendar'
```

**New code:**

```typescript
import { BryntumScrollOptions } from '@bryntum/calendar'
```

## LocaleManager function removals

`LocaleManager.registerLocale`, which was deprecated in v5.3.0, has been removed.
[LocaleHelper.publishLocale](#Core/localization/LocaleHelper#function-publishLocale-static) should be used instead.

**Old code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.registerLocale('Es', {
    desc : 'Spanish', locale : {
        localeName : 'Es',
        localeDesc : 'Spanish',
        locale     : {
            /* localization */
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
LocaleHelper.publishLocale({
    localeName : 'Es',
    localeDesc : 'Spanish',
    localeCode : 'es',
    /* localization */
});
```

`LocaleManager.extendLocale`, which was deprecated in v5.3.0, has been removed.
[LocaleManager.applyLocale](#Core/localization/LocaleManager#function-applyLocale) should be used instead.

**Old code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.extendLocale('Es', {
    desc : 'Spanish', locale : {
        locale : {
            /* localization */
        }
    }
});
```

**New code:**

```javascript
LocaleManager.applyLocale({
    localeName : 'Es',
    localeDesc : 'Spanish',
    localeCode : 'es',
    /* localization */
});
```

Check our [localization guide](#Calendar/guides/customization/localization.md#locales) for the details.

## Validating CrudManager responses by default

The `validateResponse` flag on CrudManager was changed to default to `true` in v5.0.3. When enabled, it validates 
CrudManager responses from the backend and outputs a message on console if the format isn't valid. This is helpful 
during the development phase, but can be turned off in production:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
   crudManager : {
       // Turn response validation off
       validateResponse : false,
       ...
   } 
});
```

## New module bundle for Angular

Bryntum Calendar is since V5.1.0 delivered with a ES Module bundle without WebComponents. This was done to avoid 
conflicts with Angular which also uses WebComponents for applications.

Angular wrappers use `calendar.module.js` bundle in favor of removed `calendar.lite.umd.js` one.

Your Angular applications should be upgraded to use the new `calendar.module.js` bundle which is set as `main` for
`@bryntum/calendar` NPM package.

Replace all application imports from Bryntum packages as shown below:

**Old code:**

```javascript
import { Calendar } from '@bryntum/calendar/calendar.lite.umd.js';
```

**New code:**

```javascript
import { Calendar } from '@bryntum/calendar';
```

## New module bundle with WebComponents

Bryntum Calendar is since v5.1.0 delivered with a new `calendar.wc.module.js` ES Module bundle with WebComponents.

Your applications which use WebComponents and modules bundle should be upgraded to import from new
`calendar.wc.module.js` instead of `calendar.module.js`.

## Angular View Engine wrappers for Angular 11 and older

A new `@bryntum/calendar-angular-view` package designed to work with Angular 11 and older versions, which use the View
Engine for rendering, was added in v5.3.3. If you are using one of the legacy Angular versions, please follow these
steps to use the package:

Install the package using npm:

```shell
npm install @bryntum/calendar-angular-view@6.0.0
```

Import the component in your Angular application:

```typescript
import { BryntumCalendarComponent } from '@bryntum/calendar-angular-view';
```

Do not forget to remove previously used `@bryntum/calendar-angular` package which requires Angular 12 or newer version.

Please check [Angular integration guide](#Calendar/guides/integration/angular/guide.md#ivy-and-view-engine-wrappers) for
additional information.

## DatePicker's `events` property removed

The `events` config in the Calendar sidebar's `DatePicker` was renamed to `showEvents` in v5.1.4. The `events` property
has been removed.

**Old code:**

```javascript
new Calendar({
    datePicker : {
        events : 'count'
    },
    ...
})
```

**New code:**

```javascript
new Calendar({
    datePicker : {
        showEvents : 'count'
    },
    ...
})
```

## EventList count property deprecated

The `count` property was deprecated and will be removed in 7.0, use the new `eventCount` property instead.

**Old code:**
```javascript
   descriptionRenderer() {
       return `${this.count} Events`;
   }
```

**New code:**
```javascript
   descriptionRenderer() {
       return `${this.eventCount} Events`;
   }
```

## Store now defaults to use raw data for remotely loaded data

The `useRawData` setting on `Store` is now enabled by default when data is loaded remotely using an `AjaxStore` or a 
`CrudManager`, but with all sub-settings disabled. This will boost load performance slightly, by not cloning the
incoming data objects.

If you want to restore the previous behavior, you can set `useRawData : false` on the store:

```javascript
const calendar = new Calendar({
    eventStore : {
        useRawData : false
    }
});
```

## `ExternalEventSource` drop events renamed.

The `drop` events in the `ExternalEventSource` feature have been renamed to conform to the wider Bryntum product standard.

In Calendar 5.x, there was a `dropExternal` event which was preventable which fired before the drop had been effected and an `afterDropExternal`
which fired when the operation was complete.

In 6.x, these events are named in line with all other events, in that there is now `beforeDropExternal` as the preventable event before the
drop is effected and the `dropExternal` event is fired when the operation is complete.

**Old code:**
```javascript
   listeners {
       dropExternal(drag) {
           // Disallow dropping on Tuesdays
           if (drag.target.hit.date.getDay() === 2) {
                return false;
           }
       },
       afterDropExternal(drag) {
           Toast.show(`${drag.eventRecord.name} added`);
       }
   }
```

**New code:**
```javascript
   listeners {
       beforeDropExternal(drag) {
           // Disallow dropping on Tuesdays
           if (drag.target.hit.date.getDay() === 2) {
                return false;
           }
       },
       dropExternal(drag) {
           Toast.show(`${drag.eventRecord.name} added`);
       }
   }
```
