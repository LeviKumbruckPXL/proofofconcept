# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v6.0.2

## TimelineHistogram class getRectClass config is deprecated

`TimelineHistogram` class `getRectClass` config is deprecated in favor of new `getBarClass` config to make naming more
consistent. The old config is still there but will be eliminated in v7.0.0 release so please make sure you code is updated respectively.

Old code:

```javascript
new TimelineHistogram({
    getRectClass : () => {
        ...
    }
})
```

New code:

```javascript
new TimelineHistogram({
    getBarClass : () => {
        ...
    }
})
```
