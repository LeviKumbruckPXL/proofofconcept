# Upgrade guide for Scheduler v6.1.6

## Setting Scheduler stepUnit deprecated

Setting the `Scheduler` `stepUnit` property has been deprecated in favor of new `shiftIncrement`. `stepUnit` is a read-only
property which produces a human readable version of the `shiftIncrement` for UIs. The old config is still there but will be
eliminated in v7.0.0 release so please make sure you code is updated respectively.

Old code:

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    // Had to be just a unit name
    stepUnit : 'week'
})
```

New code:

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    // May contain a magnitude as well as unit name
    shiftIncrement : '2 days'
})
```
