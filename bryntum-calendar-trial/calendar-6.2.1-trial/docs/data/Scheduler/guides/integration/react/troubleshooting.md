# Troubleshooting Bryntum Scheduler with React

## Version requirements

Minimum supported:

* React: `16.0.0` or higher
* TypeScript: `3.6.0` or higher (for TypeScript application)
* Sass: `1.78.0` or higher (for application, which uses `*.scss` styles)
* Vite `4.0.0` or higher (for application build with Vite)

Recommended:

* React: `18.0.0` or higher
* TypeScript: `4.0.0` or higher (for TypeScript application)
* Sass: `1.78.0` or higher (for application, which uses `*.scss` styles)
* Vite `5.0.0` or higher (for application build with Vite)

## Installing, building or running

If you encounter issues with installing or building your application, they can often be resolved by clearing the npm
cache for the project and global npm packages.

Run the following commands in your application folder to clean the package cache, remove installed packages, and
reinstall all project dependencies:

<div class="docs-tabs" data-name="cleanup">
<div>
    <a>MacOS/Linux</a>
    <a>Windows</a>
</div>
<div>

<strong>npm</strong>

```shell
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

<strong>yarn</strong>

```shell
yarn cache clean
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
yarn install
```

</div>
<div>

<strong>npm</strong>

```shell
npm cache clean --force
rmdir node_modules /s /q
del package-lock.json
npm install
```

<strong>yarn</strong>

```shell
yarn cache clean
rmdir node_modules /s /q
del package-lock.json
yarn install
```
</div>
</div>

## The Bryntum Scheduler bundle was loaded multiple times

```text
The Bryntum Scheduler bundle was loaded multiple times by the application.
```

The error above usually means that somewhere you have imported both the module and UMD versions of the Bryntum Scheduler 
package. Inspect the code and import from a single version of the Bryntum Scheduler bundle. We recommend using the default
module of the `@bryntum/scheduler` package (points to the module bundle):

```javascript
import { Scheduler } from '@bryntum/scheduler';
```

For more information on other causes of the error, please see
[this guide](#Scheduler/guides/gettingstarted/es6bundle.md#troubleshooting).

## Vite application

### Optimize dependencies

When using Vite with React to run a Bryntum application in development mode (`npm run dev`), in order to fix loading
bundles multiple times and avoid runtime error, it is recommended to include Bryntum packages in the 
[optimizeDeps](https://vitejs.dev/config/dep-optimization-options.html) in **vite.config.js** as shown below.

<div class="note">

This is only recommended for full Bryntum npm packages (<strong>@bryntum/scheduler</strong>). Don't use this for <strong>thin</strong> packages
(<strong>@bryntum/scheduler-thin</strong>)

</div>

**vite.config.ts**:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    plugins      : [react()],
    optimizeDeps : {
        include : ['@bryntum/scheduler', '@bryntum/scheduler-react']
    }
});
```

### Circular dependencies

During a Vite Rollup production build with Bryntum **thin** packages, you may see "Circular dependency" warnings. This
occurs because the Bryntum API relies on the ES6 specification, which permits certain circular dependencies.

To suppress these warnings, configure your Vite application `build` as shown below. For more information, refer to the 
[Rollup documentation](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#onlog).

Example `vite.config.ts` or `vite.config.mts` file:

```javascript
// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    build        : {
        rollupOptions : {
            onLog(level, log, handler) {
                if (log.code === 'CIRCULAR_DEPENDENCY') {
                    return; // Ignore circular dependency warnings
                }
            }
        }
    }
});
```

## JavaScript heap out of memory

"JavaScript heap out of memory" error occurs on large projects where the default amount of memory allocated by node is
not sufficient to complete the command successfully.

You can increase this amount by running the following command:

**For Linux/macOS:**

```shell
export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192
```

**For Windows powershell:**

```shell
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192"
```

Alternatively you can increase the amount of memory by adding the following
`NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192'` config to `scripts` section in **package.json** file:

**For example change used build script:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "your-build-script"
  }
}
```

**to:**

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "cross-env NODE_OPTIONS='--max-old-space-size=8192' your-build-script"
  }
}
```

To apply this environment config you need `cross-env` npm library which can be installed to devDependencies with:

```shell
nmp install cross-env --save-dev
```

## Legacy peer dependencies

When you use **npm** v7 or above to install application, it checks that application dependencies have valid versions
compared to the other packages used.

If you want change some dependency version you may use
[npm-shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-shrinkwrap) for this to set the valid version you want.

Another approach is to install other dependency packages for new **npm** versions above v7 with the
`--legacy-peer-deps` config flag enabled. Please read information in
[npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/using-npm/config#legacy-peer-deps).

**Example:**

Create **.npmrc** in application folder with the following code:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
```

This will allow using `npm install` without errors.

<div class="note">

We recommend upgrading your application to use a newer framework version instead of working around it. This will help to resolve issues with outdated
peer dependencies

</div>

## Openssl legacy provider

When using Node 18+ for application which uses legacy dependencies, you may receive this error during compilation:

```bash
Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported
```

To resolve this issue create `.npmrc` file in the application folder and put this inside:

```txt
node-options="--openssl-legacy-provider"
```

Alternate solution is to open a terminal and export the environment variable before running your Node.js application:

**Mac, Ubuntu (and other Linux distributions):**

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

**Windows (command prompt)**

```bash
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```bash
$env:NODE_OPTIONS="--openssl-legacy-provider"
```

## Icons missing

Bryntum uses [Dart SASS](https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass) to compile CSS from SCSS for the included themes. It outputs 
CSS encoded with UTF-8. The encoding is specified at the top of the CSS file as a `@charset` tag:

```css
@charset "UTF-8";
```

It is important that this tag is preserved in the CSS used on page, to guarantee that font icons render as intended.

Minified CSS instead uses a byte order mark to specify encoding, which although invisible to the eye should be preserved
in the file used on page.

If you use a custom build process that includes our CSS and icons are not rendered correctly in all browsers, the issue
is most likely caused by missing encoding info. Try adding it back or serving the CSS with correct encoding specified
in the HTTP header.

## SASS deprecation warnings for Vite applications

When using Dart Sass 1.80.0+ with projects written with Vite, you may encounter deprecation warnings like:

```shell
Deprecation Warning: Global built-in functions are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
Deprecation Warning: Sass @import rules are deprecated and will be removed in Dart Sass 3.0.0.
```

These warnings highlight features that will be removed in future releases, specifically in Dart Sass 3.0.0. 

Here is how to handle these warnings and gradually migrate your Sass code for future compatibility.
Configure `vite.config.*` configuration file to Silence Deprecation Warnings adding a `css` config as shown below:

<div class="note">

The list of deprecations may vary depending on the specific SCSS features used in your project

</div>

Sample config:

```javascript
export default defineConfig({
    ...
    css : {
        preprocessorOptions : {
            scss : {
                silenceDeprecations : [
                    'import',
                    'global-builtin',
                    'color-functions',
                    'legacy-js-api'
                ]
            }
        }
    }
});
```
