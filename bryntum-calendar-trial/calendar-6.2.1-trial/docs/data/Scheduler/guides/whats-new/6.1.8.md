# What's new in Scheduler v6.1.8

## `rtl` config of `Widget`
The `rtl` config property of Widgets is now public. By default Widgets conform to the writing direction of the element
they are rendered to. But with the now public `rtl` property, you can force a widget, and all descendant widgets to lay
out from right to left.

## `EventCopyPaste` pattern pasting
The `EventCopyPaste` feature will now paste multiple events into the same pattern they were copied. To revert to the
previous behaviour of pasting all copied events to the same target resource and date, set `unifiedPaste` on the feature
config object to `false`.

```javascript
new Scheduler({
    features : {
        eventCopyPaste : {
            // This reverts to the previous behaviour
            unifiedPaste : false
        }
    }
})
```
