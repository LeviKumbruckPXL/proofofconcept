# What's new in Scheduler v6.2.0

## New TreeSummary feature

A feature that allows you to roll up and display values in the time axis cell for each parent row in a tree scheduler.

```javascript
new Scheduler({
     features : {
         treeSummary : {
             summaryRenderer({ startDate, endDate, resourceRecord, timeline }) {
                 let totalDemandedCapacity = 0;

                 resourceRecord.traverse(node => {
                     node.events.forEach(task => {
                         if (DateHelper.intersectSpans(task.startDate, task.endDate, startDate, endDate)) {
                             totalDemandedCapacity += task.demandedCapacity || 0;
                         }
                     });
                 }, true);

                 if (timeline.project.effectiveCalendar.isWorkingTime(startDate, endDate)) {
                     return 1 - totalDemandedCapacity;
                 }
                 else {
                     return 0;
                 }
             }
         }
     }
});
```

There are also two new demos ([Tree summary](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/tree-summary/) and [Tree summary custom](https://bryntum.com/products/scheduler/examples/tree-summary-custom/)) that demonstrates the new functionality.

## Event highlighting

Event highlighting has been added to the Scheduler API. You can programmatically highlight one or more available events
or assignments in the timeline by calling `highlightEvents`.

The highlighting will be removed when the user clicks somewhere in the browser window (this behavior can be changed).
You can also remove the highlighting programmatically.

If the events being highlighted is not in view, the closest one of them will be scrolled into view (this behavior can
also be changed).

````javascript
// This will highlight events with id 1, 2 and 3.
// And, if necessary, scroll them into view.
// And remove the highlighting on window click
// Only singleAssignment mode
scheduler.highlightEvents([1,2,3]);

// This will highlight a specific assignment
// Without scrolling (second argument)
// And removing the highlight after 5s only (third argument)
scheduler.highlightEvents(assignmentRecord, false, false);
setTimeout(() => scheduler.unhighlightEvents(assignmentRecord), 5000);
````

## Quicker dependency removal

You can now delete dependencies quickly by clicking the line to reveal a delete icon. This is a more intuitive way to
delete dependencies than the previous method of right-clicking the line and selecting "Delete". You can toggle this
new behavior with the `enableDelete` config option.

```javascript
const scheduler = new Scheduler({
    features : {
        dependencies : {
            // Disable the new delete icon (on by default)
            enableDelete : false
        }
    }
});
```

Try it out in any demo that uses dependencies, or here:
