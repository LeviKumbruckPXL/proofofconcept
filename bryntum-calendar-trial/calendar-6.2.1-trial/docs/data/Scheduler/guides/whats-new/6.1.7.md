# What's new in Scheduler v6.1.76

## New `scrollAction` config in CellEditing

The `scrollAction` config specifies what action should be taken if an active cell editor is scrolled out of view.

It may be set to `'cancel'`, `'complete'` or `null`.

The default value is `null` which means the edit is preserved.
